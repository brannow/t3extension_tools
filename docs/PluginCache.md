Switchable Caching For Plugins
==============================


TYPO3 allows to register controller action either cacheable or non-cacheable.

This feature allows to configure this behaviour independently for each plugin instance.

**Note** We extend the class `TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Service\ExtensionService`. Make this does not collide with alternative Implementations.
